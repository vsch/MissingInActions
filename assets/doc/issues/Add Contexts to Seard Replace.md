### Add Standard Contexts to Search and Replace Editor Panel

To eliminate the need to leave the search/replace panel and quickly limit effect of
search/replace add context actions:

- Current Compound Body: to select text between (in Java `{ }`) and check` In Selection` 
- Current Method: to select text between of method (in Java `{ }`) and check` In Selection` 
- Current Line: to select the line...
- Plugin's selection stack: show drop down of available selections and if one is selected check
  the `In Selection` option.

Another enhancement will come with selection stack, allowing recall of selections search/replace
blew away when `In Selection` was unchecked or typing in one of the text boxes with this setting
unselected. Both of which clear the selection.
